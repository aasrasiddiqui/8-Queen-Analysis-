\# 8-Queen Analysis



This project analyzes the classic \*\*8-Queens problem\*\* using \*\*two different approaches\*\* and compares their performance:



1\. \*\*CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) with Forward Checking and Backtracking\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Explores the search space systematically  

&nbsp;  - Ensures constraints are satisfied before placing queens  

&nbsp;  - Uses backtracking when conflicts arise



2\. \*\*Hill Climbing with Random Restart\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Uses a heuristic approach  

&nbsp;  - Starts with a random configuration  

&nbsp;  - Iteratively moves towards a solution  

&nbsp;  - Uses random restarts to escape local maxima



\## Features



\- Implements both CSP and Hill Climbing algorithms for the 8-Queens problem  

\- Compares performance and efficiency of the two approaches  

\- Outputs solution configurations and steps taken to reach them  



\## How to Use



1\. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `8 Queen Analysis.ipynb`  

2\. Run all cells sequentially  

3\. Observe the comparison between \*\*CSP Backtracking\*\* and \*\*Hill Climbing with Random Restart\*\*
